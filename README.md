# Password-Generator
This Python program generates a random password using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. It's designed to create a secure password that's difficult to guess or crack. Below is a detailed description:

Purpose
The code aims to:

Generate a strong password.
Include a mix of character types (letters, numbers, symbols) for enhanced security.
Create a password of a specific length (16 characters by default).
Key Features
Randomness:

The random.choice() function ensures each character is chosen randomly from the pool of available characters.
Character Diversity:

The chars string contains:
Lowercase letters: a-z
Numbers: 0-9
Special characters: !@#$%^&*()?
This diversity increases password strength.
Customizable Length:

The length of the password can be easily adjusted by changing the range in the for loop.
Easy to Use:

The code is simple and straightforward, requiring no input from the user.
How It Works
A pool of characters (chars) is defined, which includes all possible characters that the password may contain.
A loop runs 16 times (default length of the password).
In each iteration, one random character is picked from the chars pool and added to the password string.
Once the loop is complete, the generated password is printed.
Use Cases
Personal Use: Create strong passwords for social media, email, or online accounts.
Professional Use: Generate temporary passwords for work-related accounts or projects.
Learning: Understand how randomness works in programming and how to apply it to real-world problems.
Limitations
No Uppercase Letters: By default, the password only includes lowercase letters, which might not meet some password policy requirements.
Fixed Characters Set: The set of characters used can be expanded to include more symbols or uppercase letters.
Not User-Interactive: It generates a password without user input, which might not be ideal for some cases.
